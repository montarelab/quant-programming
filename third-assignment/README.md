# üìÖ Day 3: Derivatives Pricing (Options)

## üéØ Goal:

- Implement pricing models for European call and put options.
- Compare the Black-Scholes analytical solution with Monte Carlo simulation.

## üìñ Topics Covered

### 1. Call & Put Options

- A **call option** gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy an asset at a specified price (strike price) on or before expiration.
- A **put option** gives the holder the right to sell an asset at a specified price on or before expiration.

### 2. Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega)

- **Delta ($\Delta$)**: Sensitivity of the option price to the underlying asset price.
- **Gamma ($\Gamma$)**: Sensitivity of Delta to the underlying asset price.
- **Vega ($\nu$)**: Sensitivity of the option price to volatility changes.

### 3. Black-Scholes Pricing Formula

The **Black-Scholes Model** provides a closed-form solution to price European options.

#### **European Call Option Price:**

$$
C = S_0 N(d_1) - Ke^{-rt} N(d_2)
$$

#### **European Put Option Price:**

$$
P = Ke^{-rt} N(-d_2) - S_0 N(-d_1)
$$

Where:

$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0/K) + (r + \sigma^2/2) t}{\sigma \sqrt{t}}
$$

$$
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{t}
$$

- $S_0$ = Current stock price
- $K$ = Strike price
- $r$ = Risk-free interest rate
- $\sigma$ = Volatility
- $t$ = Time to expiration
- $N(d)$ = Cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution

### 4. Monte Carlo Method for Option Pricing

- Simulates multiple future price paths of the underlying asset using random sampling.
- Each path follows a geometric Brownian motion:

$$
S_T = S_0 e^{(r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2)T + \sigma W_T}
$$

- Where $W_T$ is a Wiener process (random normal variable).
- The option price is computed as the discounted average payoff:

$$
C = e^{-rt} \mathbb{E} [\max(S_T - K, 0)]
$$

$$
P = e^{-rt} \mathbb{E} [\max(K - S_T, 0)]
$$

- The larger the number of simulations, the more accurate the estimate.

## üõ†Ô∏è Assignment Tasks

### 1. Implement Black-Scholes pricing for European call and put options.

- Write a function to compute the option price using the closed-form Black-Scholes formula.

### 2. Implement Monte Carlo simulation for European options.

- Generate multiple random price paths using the Geometric Brownian Motion model.
- Calculate the expected payoff and discount it to the present.

### 3. Compare Monte Carlo vs. Analytical Pricing.

- Run both models with the same inputs and compare the results.
- Measure the accuracy of Monte Carlo with different numbers of simulations.
- Discuss convergence and variance reduction techniques (e.g., Antithetic Variates, Control Variates).

## üí° Bonus Challenges (Optional)

- Implement the **Greeks** (Delta, Gamma, Vega) for both methods.
- Use **Variance Reduction Techniques** to improve Monte Carlo efficiency.
- Try **Implied Volatility Calculation**: Given an option price, find $\sigma$.
