---

## 📅 Day 6: Algorithmic Trading & Execution Strategies

**Goal:** Build a simple algorithmic trading bot.  

### 📖 Topics:
- Momentum vs. Mean Reversion strategies  
- Backtesting frameworks (Backtrader, Zipline)  
- Order execution & slippage  

### 🛠️ Assignment:
- Implement a momentum-based trading bot.  
- Backtest it on real stock data.
